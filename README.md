## Overview

1. Live demo link coming soon!
2. I started with some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.  I didn't know how to connect SQL to a website, but from my experience making discord bots I knew how to connect SQL to Python so I looked up how to connect Python to HTML and discovered the web framework Django.  After a few tutorials and reading the documentation I figured out how to use it.  I occasionaly struggled with things not loading and figuring out roper syntax, but there were thankfully a lot of forums which helped me.
3. I learned about web frameworks and improved my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more effectively
